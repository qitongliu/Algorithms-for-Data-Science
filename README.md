DFS: Connected Components of Undirected Graphs 
Use the NetworkX Python package to represent and manipulate graphs
Implement DFS algorithm for identifying the connected components of an undirected graph

Max Flow: Movie Distribution
Design and implement a max flow algorithm for shipping movies between nodes with different supply and demand requirements.

Min Cost Flow and Linear Programming
Given a flow network with capacities and costs, the goal is to find a feasible flow, that is a flow satisfying edge capacity constraints and node demands-- that minimizes the total cost of the flow. Explicitly, the problem can be formulated as a linear program.

NP-Hard Problems: Independent Set 
An independent set in a graph is a set of nodes such that no two nodes are adjacent (connected by an edge). Finding the maximum size of an independent set in a graph is an NP-hard problem, so there is no known polynomial-time algorithm to solve it. 
I will use integer programming and linear programming relaxation to solve it.

# Algorithms for Data Science

1. DFS: Connected Components of Undirected Graphs   
Use the NetworkX Python package to represent and manipulate graphs   
Implement DFS algorithm for identifying the connected components of an undirected graph   

2. Max Flow: Movie Distribution    
Design and implement a max flow algorithm for shipping movies between nodes with different supply and demand requirements.   

3. Min Cost Flow and Linear Programming     
Given a flow network with capacities and costs, the goal is to find a feasible flow, that is a flow satisfying edge capacity constraints and node demands-- that minimizes the total cost of the flow. Explicitly, the problem can be formulated as a linear program.     

4. NP-Hard Problems: Independent Set     
An independent set in a graph is a set of nodes such that no two nodes are adjacent (connected by an edge). Finding the maximum size of an independent set in a graph is an NP-hard problem, so there is no known polynomial-time algorithm to solve it.    
Use integer programming and linear programming relaxation to solve it.
